A cap is a form of headgear. Caps have crowns that fit very close to the head. They made their first appearance as early as 3,200BC. Caps typically have a visor or no brim at all.  Caps are more popular in casual and informal settings, and you will notice them in sports and fashion.  All genders and ages enjoy wearing caps. They are typically designed for warmth, and often incorporate a visor to block sunlight from the eyes. They come in many shapes, sizes, and are of different brands. Baseball caps are one of the most common headgear caps. Until 1954 baseball players could pick any kind of cap they wanted, just to keep the sun out of their eyes. And that's pretty much where it all began.
